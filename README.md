# Market-Segmentation-Analysis
        Using Machine Learning Algorithm and Python we predict the value of industry by Data wrangling and Data visualization
# Project
    Although Market Segmentation has been developed to be a key marketing strategy applied in many organizations, it is not always the best decision to pursue such a strategy. Before investing time and resources in a market segmentation analysis, it is important to understand the implications of pursuing a market segmentation strategy. The key implication is that the organization needs to commit to the segmentation strategy on the long term. Segmenting a market is not free. There are costs of performing research, fielding surveys, and focus groups, designing multiple packages, and designing multiple advertisements and communication messages. 
    Potentially required changes include the development of new products, the modification of existing products, changes in pricing and distribution channels used to sell the product, as well as all communications with the market. These changes, in turn, are likely to influence the internal structure of the organisation, which may need to be adjusted in view of, for example, targeting a handful of different market segments. Because of the major implications of such a long-term organisational commitment, the decision to investigate the potential of a market segmentation strategy must be made at the highest executive level, and must be systematically and continuously communicated and reinforced at all organisational levels and across all organisational units. 

# Step1:
Imported the libraries.
# step2:
In this project we took MCdonalds dataset.
# step3:
Replacing values with the 'Like' column of the dataframe with numeric values using the 'replace()' method.
# step4:
Segmenting the various sets of feedback like yummy, convenient, spicy, fattening, greasy, fast, cheap, tasty, expensive, healthy, disgusting, Like.
# step 5:
Using KMeans method we did clustering of elements in the dataset.
# step 6:
We described the segments in the view of graphical perspective in the order of -5 to +5 the rating.
# step 7:
Using Mosaic plot we figured out the data into plotvise.
# step 8:
Next we had seprated the Gender and Age. According to that analysis has done on Age vs Segment_Number
